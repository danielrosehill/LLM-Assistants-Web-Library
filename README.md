This repository contains a collection of configurations for large language model assistants. 

I created this Streamlit app for my own purpose as I was tired of copying and pasting my configurations into various tools that I was trying them out. 

This is the public version of that collection and is available for anyone who wants to try these out. 

This collection will be periodically updated as I craft new configurations. 

## Features To Add (My To-Do List)

- Add JSON export functionality (convert config to JSON & download)
- Add logic to include a notes section and exclude from main config for copying
- Add YAML frontmatter to include things like vision capability (implemented) and notes on recommended LLMs
- Implement a functionality for marking favorite configs
